It seems like you're facing an issue where sometimes a URL opened through Selenium using ChromeDriver shows a blank page, even though the same URL opens normally when manually opened in a new tab. This sporadic behavior can be challenging to debug. Here are a few steps you can consider to troubleshoot the problem:

1. **Check Network Activity**: Use the BrowserMob Proxy to capture network activity for both scenarios (Selenium and manual). Compare the network requests and responses to see if there's any difference.

2. **Wait and Timing**: Make sure that you are waiting for the page to fully load before interacting with it. Some content might load asynchronously, so using explicit waits can help ensure the page is fully loaded before proceeding.

3. **Logging and Debugging**: Introduce logging statements at various points in your script to better understand the flow of execution. This could help identify any inconsistencies.

4. **Page Source Comparison**: After the page loads, you can use Selenium to fetch the page source for both scenarios (Selenium and manual). Compare the page sources to identify any differences that might lead to the blank page issue.

5. **Update Chrome and Drivers**: Ensure you're using the latest version of Chrome, ChromeDriver, and Selenium. Sometimes compatibility issues can lead to unexpected behavior.

6. **Try Different WebDriver Methods**: Instead of using `get()` method, you could try `navigate.to()` to see if there's any difference in behavior.

7. **Disable Experimental Options**: Try removing the experimental options one at a time and see if the issue persists. The experimental options might interact with each other in unexpected ways.

8. **Check JavaScript Errors**: Use the WebDriver to execute JavaScript code on the page to check for any JavaScript errors that might be causing the issue.

9. **Headless Mode**: Try running the browser in headless mode to see if the issue is specific to the browser window.

10. **Capture Screenshots**: If possible, capture screenshots during both scenarios to visually compare what is being displayed.

11. **Isolate the Issue**: Create a minimal reproduction of the issue with a simplified version of your script. This can help narrow down whether the problem lies in your code or external factors.

Remember, intermittent issues like this can be complex to diagnose. Sometimes, it could even be an issue outside of your control, like network fluctuations or server-side problems. Patience and systematic debugging will be key in resolving the problem.
